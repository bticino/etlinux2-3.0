This customization creates a compressed image of an ext2 filesystem.
The output file is called "ramdisk.gz" irrespective of the configuration
name (as calling if <config>.gz would be easily misinterpreted).

The size of the filesystem is inherited from the environment variable
RAMDISK_SIZE, that must be the number of kilobytes to use. If no such
variable is set, the script selects 1MB more than the size of
installed data.

This customization is meant as an example to be adapted to your own
needs.
