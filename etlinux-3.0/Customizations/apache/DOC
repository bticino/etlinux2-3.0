This customization adds some apache support files (apache.conf, mime.types, 
apache startup script, ...), and creates the proper user and group in 
/etc/passwd and /etc/group. Finally, the DocumentRoot directory is created 
and Etlinux.html is copied into it.

The following apache configuration items can be customized by properly  
setting some environment variables:

* DocumentRoot : by default it is set to /home/www . Export 
  APACHE_DOCUMENT_ROOT to override the default value.
  
* ServerAdmin : by default it is set to root. Export 
  APACHE_SERVER_ADMIN to override the default value

* ServerName : by default it is set to localhost. Export 
  APACHE_SERVER_NAME to override the default value.


WARNING: the apache config file contained in this customization 
does not load modssl.
