This is etlinux-3.0-devel in its initial status.

FIXME(s):

* Only Etlinux-minimum configuration compiles.
* Documentation has to be updated.
* Most of the packages still have to be added.

Generally speaking the whole stuff hasn't been tested very much. So 
expect problems when compiling/running this.
