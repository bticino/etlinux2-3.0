###### Mandatory stuff (libc and ettcl are required by default)
package = ettcl-init

package = mount

###### Extra services (at little cost)
package = ettcl-telnetd
package = ettcl-cmdd
package = ettcl-httpd
package = sample-html
package = sample-cgi

###### This stuff is not really needed (we use it in the bigger version)

#package = bash
#package = procps
#package = tar
#package = fileutils
#package = textutils
#package = sh-utils
#package = util-linux
